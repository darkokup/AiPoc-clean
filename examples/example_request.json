Current therapeutic options provide inadequate disease control in a significant proportion of patients. ACM-1234 is a novel small molecule with a unique mechanism of action targeting key inflammatory pathways. Preclinical studies and Phase 1 data have demonstrated promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile. This Phase 2 study aims to establish proof-of-concept for ACM-1234 in patients with moderate to severe Chronic Disease X.",
